Pronto is a very simple, light-weight web content management system for .NET.
It is built on top of the ASP.NET MVC library.
Pronto is ideal for small websites and even works in shared hosting environments due to its simple file-based data storage.

Pronto evolved over the course of a few websites developed for clients who needed something super easy to use. The admin experience is very "inline" so admin users don't have to learn any complex UI.

The page template plug-in system makes it easy to add custom widgets into HTML. Also, being ASP.NET MVC based means you can still add your own controllers for other processing.
